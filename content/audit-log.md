The Audit Log records activities carried out by administrators and users within the TempusMail control panel. It is a critical tool for security monitoring and troubleshooting administrative actions.

## Information Recorded

For each event, the log captures:
- **Date/Time**: When the action occurred.
- **Actor**: The account/user who performed the action.
- **Action**: Brief description (e.g., "Created Domain", "Changed Password").
- **Location**: Country/IP of the actor.
- **System Details**: Extract of system logs related to the event.

## Filtering Capabilities

You can filter audit logs by:
- **Time frame**: Specific dates.
- **User**: Specific admin or team member.
- **Type of Action**: Creation, Deletion, Modification, etc.
- **Subject**: The object being acted upon (e.g., specific domain name).

**Include Audits Queries**: Option to see details of searches performed by admins, not just state-changing actions.
